                          The desire to financially empower the under-privileged
                          population in our communities led to the formation of
                          Microfinance Banks across the country. However, key
                          challenges facing these institutions include
                          inadequate automation to streamline internal
                          operations, lack of enough capital to meet the
                          challenges of high demand of credits, lack of Products
                          that would meet the yearnings of the target clients
                          and above all the strangulating operating environment.
                          Understanding these hurdles, and the desire to
                          overcome them made Nasarawa Microfinance Bank Ltd to
                          take up the challenge and singled out itself with
                          efficient operations through Product delivery, quality
                          and accessible financial services, as well as process
                          automation to improve the livelihood of its customers
                          that cut across the nooks and crannies of Nasarawa
                          State. 90% of the population of Nasarawa State in the
                          2006 census classified the State as an agrarian State;
                          as such the Bank made agriculture and agricultural
                          value chain support as one of its main business
                          activities. On this premise, it has been partnering
                          with many organizations to achieve this important
                          feat. Amongst many are: Central Bank of Nigeriaâ€™s
                          numerous intervention programs on Agriculture since
                          2016, GIZ AgFin Project (A German Support Program for
                          Agriculture) since 2018 and IFAD/FGN Value Chain
                          Development Programme. (VCDP)
