                          The bank is presently owned by the shareholders in Nasarawa Local Government Area. This placed it in  a demanding position to meet the community's Corporate Social 
                          Responsibility. The Community and Nasarawa State at large is an agrarian society, therefore the bank has a responsibility of developing farming techniques in the community.
                          This would have a wide impact in the socio-economic status of the populace. Considering the impoverish nature of the people, the bank has to procure some farming equipment and machineries
                          that would change farming techniques for better output. The implements are leased out to communities at a subsidized amount and also on credit, payable after harvest. This notwithstanding,
                          it also collaborate with Research Institutions across the country to get improved seedlings and also with Chemical Companies to get genuine agro-chemicals for the farmers. It is also developing
                          Communities to develop agricultural value chain  business to improve value of the their produce.<em></em>
