                          The bank started as a Community Bank in March 1993 and
                          converted to Unit Microfinance Bank in 2007. In 2013,
                          with consistent growth the bank became the first State
                          Microfinance Bank in Nasarawa State. However, with the
                          recent recapitalization policy of Central Bank of
                          Nigeria to strengthen the capabilities of MFBs, it
                          downscaled to Unit 1 Tier 1; with authorized
                          shareholders’ funds of a little above two hundred
                          million naira. This gives the bank leverage to
                          continue operating in the unbanked and high-density
                          areas by keeping its branches and cash centers
                          together with its staff as the law allows it to have
                          four branches outside its head office within five
                          contiguous local government areas. The outreach is
                          growing by the day; from 12,360 in 2013 to more than
                          30,000 in 2022, with the zeal to double the figures in
                          the years ahead. The bank’s mode of operations had
                          started from analogue to digital and of recent
                          internet or electronic banking backed up with robust
                          software. This has put the bank on a pedestal of
                          competing not only with its peers but commercial banks
                          and that can be attested from the ATM and other
                          electronic devices provided in its branches and cash
                          center.
